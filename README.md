# iOS-App-Analysis

This is a repository for mobile



## How does it work?


## Prerequisites for the analytical method:
The method have some prerequisites that must be fulfilled before the analysis, this is mostly setting up accounts for interacting with iOS and Android
API services, developer environments, devices, and installation of certain programs.


For iOS app analysis, an AppleID is needed which has been set up to be used with the Apple AppStore. To do this, a phone number must be connected to the id, the AppleID needs to be verified with an email and have been used once before to download an app from the AppStore. Circumventing these security measurements means that we canâ€™t recommend using your main account in this method. To download the apps and connect to the iOS either a computer running MacOS or Linux are required. Finally, an iOS device with a Jailbreak is needed as the analysis, compared to Android apps, will be conducted on the device. The Jailbreak will need access to a working store/repository manager like Cydia or Sileo to install the Frida-server on the device that allows us to interact with applications on the device.
